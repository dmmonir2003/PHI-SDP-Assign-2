          var:Function-scoped,visible throughout the entire function. Hoisted to
          the top of its function
        </li>
        <li>
          let: Block-scoped, visible only within the block (between curly
          braces) where it is declared.Not hoisted to the top of the block.
        </li>
        <li>
          const:Block-scoped; similar to let.Used for constants; once a value is
          assigned, it cannot be reassigned.Not hoisted to the top of the block.

        Tell us the use cases of null and undefined ?
      </h3>

      <ul class="text-center text-xl font-medium">
        <li>
          Null: When a variable is declared but intentionally not assigned a
          value, it can be set to null to explicitly indicate that it has no
          value.In some cases, it's useful to initialize a variable to null to
          indicate that it hasn't been assigned a value yet, and then assign it
          a proper value later
        </li>
        <li>
          Undefined: By default, variables that haven't been declared or
          assigned a value have an undefined value.In some cases, undefined can
          be used to represent errors or missing data in a program.
        </li>

        What do you mean by REST API?
      </h3>

      <ul class="text-center text-xl font-medium">
        <li>
          A REST API: (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of web API
          that follows the REST architectural style. REST APIs are designed to
          be easy to use and integrate.
